## App Description :scroll:
Diggraffiti is a mobile app that allows anyone to go anywhere in the world and design virtual artworks in real physical places using digital paintbrush tools. Once published, these virtual artworks' geographic coordinates are tracked and the artworks can then be viewed and liked by users that are within a five mile radius to that image.
